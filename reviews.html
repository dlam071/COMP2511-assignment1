                                <p> Wow fun game.... Sometimes your friends can be bullies. However, it is still a good time, if you enjoy watching your friends get angry, we strongly recommend picking it up. We rate it 4.5/5</p>

                                <p> The Legend of Zelda Breath of The Wild is easily one of the best games this century, nay in existence (by personal preference). We rate it 50/5 </p>

                                <img src="images/tetris.png" alt="Tetris Image"/>
                                <p> This is by far, one of the best free to play games that has been released (I mean, I guess you still have to pay for Nintendo Online but...). It takes all the fun of the original Tetris that we all love and put it into one of the best battle royal games. We rate it  4.5/5 </p>
